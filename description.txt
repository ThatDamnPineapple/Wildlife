Wildlife Mod adds new passive animals and plants to add that extra touch of atmosphere to your terraria world. You can make several new potions and get other goodies from the content.
The theme of content varies massively, from bamboo on the outskirts of your world to oysters found on the beaches.

Latest Update:

Yellow Fairy- Spawns like the others, its bottled farm grants slightly increased defense
Living Wood Mite- Spawns in living wood trees, used for bait
Gilded Crawler and Supercharged Orb- One crawls, one floats and glows, found in granite and marble biomes, these two will be polished more soon
Arctic Fox- A chilly recolor of the normal fox for snow biomes
Frost Phoenix- Spawns all around the frost biome, even underground, for some reason it likes to follow you, it may split into two upon death
Glowmasks for more items and grammatical fixes.

Venom Radish- Grows on jungle grass in hardmode, careful not to use 'quick buff' with this in your inventory or you'll be envenomed.
You can use the venom radish for stink and battle potions, as well as pre-plantera venom vials using spider legs.
Pink Marshmallow- Add a strawberry to a cooked marshmallow, extends the effects of the strawberry.
Possibly some other minor tweaks.
