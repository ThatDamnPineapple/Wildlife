Wildlife Mod adds new passive animals and plants to add that extra touch of atmosphere to your terraria world. You can make several new potions and get other goodies from the content.
The theme of content varies massively, from bamboo on the outskirts of your world to oysters found on the beaches.

Latest Update:

Venom Radish- Grows on jungle grass in hardmode, careful not to use 'quick buff' with this in your inventory or you'll be envenomed.
You can use the venom radish for stink and battle potions, as well as pre-plantera venom vials using spider legs.
Pink Marshmallow- Add a strawberry to a cooked marshmallow, extends the effects of the strawberry.
Possibly some other minor tweaks.
